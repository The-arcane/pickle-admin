- Accent color: Soft Amber (#FFB300) as a contrasting highlight color, used sparingly to draw attention to key interactive elements and important notifications.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' sans-serif for both headlines and body text to offer a modern, readable, and neutral appearance that suits both titles and detailed content areas.

- Implement a responsive layout utilizing a grid system to ensure that the admin panel functions seamlessly across various screen sizes, and maintaining consistent spacing for visual balance.
- Subtle, non-intrusive animations for state transitions (e.g., button clicks, loading sequences) to enhance user feedback and maintain engagement without being distracting.
